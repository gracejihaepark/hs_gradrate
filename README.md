# High School Graduation Rate

Linear and multiple regression models to predict graduation rate using many different independent variables

## Goal
Determine if there is a relationship between student attendance, regents scores, or teacher qualifications and graduation rates in NYC public high schools

## Exploratory Data Analysis
R^2 and p-values for each individual regent compared to graduation rate


R^2 and p-values for attendance and staff qualifications compared to graduation rate


There is a clear linear relationship between regents results and graduation rate
Earth Science usually taken in 8th grade, and Algebra in 9th, which allows for early prediction of graduation rates
